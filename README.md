# TypeScript - Algorithms 100 days of challenge
100 days of challenge doing algorithms with TypeScript. 

## I will commit 1 algorithm in TypeScript everyday.

List of algorithms so far:

1. absoluteValuesSumMinization:

The purpose of this algorithm is to return the value which is in the middle of the array.

2. add:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a any amount of input put it in an array and
add them all. :smiley:

3. addBorder:

The purpose of this algorithm is to make a border at the beginning and bend of a array of strings.
add them all. :grin:

4. addTwoDigits:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a two digt number and add each digit, so if you addTwoDigits(29) you will get 11.
add them all. :smirk:

5. adjacentElementsProducts:

This algorithm is about given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product. :smiley:

6. allLongestStrings:

Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.. :smiley:
