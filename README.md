# TypeScript - Algorithms 100 days of challenge
100 days challenge doing algorithms with TypeScript. 

## I will commit 1 algorithm in TypeScript everyday.

List of algorithms so far:

1. absoluteValuesSumMinization:

The purpose of this algorithm is to return the value which is in the middle of the array.

2. add:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a any amount of input put it in an array and
add them all. :smiley:

3. addBorder:

The purpose of this algorithm is to make a border at the beginning and bend of a array of strings.
add them all. :grin:

4. addTwoDigits:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a two digt number and add each digit, so if you addTwoDigits(29) you will get 11.
add them all. :smirk:

5. adjacentElementsProducts:

This algorithm is about given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product. :smiley:

6. allLongestStrings:

Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.. :smiley:

7. almostIncreasingSequence:

Given an array of numbers, determine whether is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.. :wink:

8. alphabeticShift:

Given a string, replace each its character by the next one in the English alphabet. :wink:

9. alphabetSubsequence:

Check whether the given string is a subsequence of the plaintext alphabet. :wink:

10. alternatingSums:

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array ot two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.:grin:


11. areEquallyStrong:

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilitiesf find out if you two are equally strong
.:grin:


12. areSimilar:

Given two arrays a and b, checke whether   they are similarf
. :wink:

13. arrayChange:

You are given an array of integers. On each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its elements by one. Find the minimal number o moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequencefrom the input. :grin:
. :wink:

14. arrayConversion:

Given an array of 2k integers (for some integer k), perform the following operations until the array contains only one element.

On the 1st, 3th 5th etc. iterations (1-based) replace each pair of consecutive elements with their sum;
On the 2nd, 4th, 6th etc iterations replace each pair  of consecutive elements with their product. After the algorithm has finished, there will be a single element left in the array. Return  that element. :relieved:

15. arrayMaxConsecutiveSum:

Given an array of integers, find the maximal possible sum of some of its k consecutive element.:wink:
