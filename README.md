# TypeScript - Algorithms 100 days of challenge
100 days of challenge doing algorithms with TypeScript. 

## I will commit 1 algorithm in TypeScript everyday.

List of algorithms so far:

1. absoluteValuesSumMinization:

The purpose of this algorithm is to return the value which is in the middle of the array.

2. add:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a any amount of input put it in an array and
add them all. :smiley:

3. addBorder:

The purpose of this algorithm is to make a border at the beginning and bend of a array of strings.
add them all. :grin:

4. addTwoDigits:

The purpose of this algorithm is to take a two digt number and add each digit, so if you addTwoDigits(29) you will get 11.
add them all. :smirk:

5. adjacentElementsProducts:

This algorithm is about given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product. :smiley:

6. allLongestStrings:

Given an array of strings, return another array containing all of its longest strings.. :smiley:

7. almostIncreasingSequence:

Given an array of numbers, determine whether is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.. :wink:

8. alphabeticShift:

Given a string, replace each its character by the next one in the English alphabet. :wink:

9. alphabetSubsequence:

Check whether the given string is a subsequence of the plaintext alphabet. :wink:

10. alternatingSums:

You are given an array of positive integers - the weights of the people. Return an array ot two integers, where the first element is the total weight of team 1, and the second element is the total weight of team 2 after the division is complete.:grin:


11. areEquallyStrong:

Given your and your friend's arms' lifting capabilitiesf find out if you two are equally strong
.:grin:


12. areSimilar:

Given two arrays a and b, checke whether   they are similarf
. :wink:
